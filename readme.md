We started the project by divvying up tasks based on front end and back end work. Brian Lee handled the model creation while the rest of us began creating the structure of the site pages (eg homepage, profile page, search, etc). Then we broke tasks up based on the necessary routes. Gabe and Brian Lee worked on the user profile edit and reviews and Brian Barello worked on the search routes. Towards the end of the project we worked a lot more as a group to integrate all of our work that'd we'd done individually.
